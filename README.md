# Description

Programming Foundations with Python

We started off with a plan:

Go to the website
See all of the movies displayed
Click on one to play it's trailer

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM!!!
1. Ensure that you have Python 2.7 or later installed.

2. To turn this program into a movie website, ensure that you download the fresh_tomatoes.py file. It is already available for download here. However, make sure the files (movie.py, entertainment.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py) are present in the same folder.

3. Open these files using IDLE.

4. You can edit the file contents following the instructions here, or the ‘#’ and “”” comments given in the code.

5. Save your work (if any editing was done), and run the entertainment.py file. It will generate the HTML page or Website [fresh_tomatoes.html], using the fresh_tomatoes.py file.
